## 🧭 Vision-Driven Development

🌍 I build purposeful digital products that benefit people in **Dunya and Akhirah**.  
💡 My work blends **modern frontend/backend development** with **Islamic design thinking**, focusing on apps that promote productivity, mindfulness, and daily Adhkar.

## 🔨 What I’m Working On

- 🕋 **Islamic Lifestyle Tools**  
  Habit-forming, beautifully designed apps that guide users through daily **morning & evening Adhkar**, inspired by *Quranly* and *Salah.com* — with streaks, reminders, audio, multilingual support.

- 🧠 **Interactive Islamic Knowledge**  
  Smart quiz-based apps to engage users in learning **Salah, Aqeedah, Fiqh**, and other Islamic fundamentals.

- 📊 **Workflow & Shift Tools**  
  Systems like `iReport` – enabling shift reports, multi-tenant control, PDF/Excel downloads, admin/user dashboards, and real-time analytics.

- 🔐 **Security & Modern Web Tools**  
  Frontend-first apps using modern stacks for seamless auth, dashboards, and reporting.
